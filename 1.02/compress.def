(* Returns TRUE if ch is a valid character for compression. *)

PROCEDURE Pack(VAR s,d:ARRAY OF CHAR; VAR n:CARDINAL);
(* Packs source string s into destination string d. s must be in PASCAL format
   and n will contain the index of the last byte occupied by the compressed
   string on return. The caller must ensure that d is of sufficient length;
   d[0] holds the first byte of the compressed string. *)
