  PROCEDURE ALLOCATE(VAR p : ADDRESS; s : CARDINAL);
  PROCEDURE DEALLOCATE(VAR p : ADDRESS; s : CARDINAL);
  
  PROCEDURE Normalize(VAR a : ADDRESS);
  (* Normalizes the address in a. Must be called if INC/DEC operations will
     be performed on this address to ensure correct results. *)
     
  PROCEDURE InverseNormalize(VAR a : ADDRESS);
  (* Similar to 'Normalize'; but maximizes the offset instead of minimizing
     it. *)
